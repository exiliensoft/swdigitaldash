build directory is optimized code, you just need to upload all the files inside this directory on the server. It will work fine.

you need to run some command after make your changes.

1. npm install yarn
2. yarn start // start the production server
3. yarn build    // to create build 

All the time you need to make the build after changes and upload the server.
